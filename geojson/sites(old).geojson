It served as a major hub for trading buffalo robes with Lakotans and Cheyenneans. In 1849, the U.S. military purchased the post, renaming it Fort Laramie, to protect miners and other emigrants heading west. The fort became a key stop for settlers, with up to 200,000 visitors during its peak.</p><p>The 1851 Horse Creek Treaty, negotiated at Fort Laramie, aimed to establish peace and protect Native hunting grounds from the encroachment of settlers. When violence broke out again during the 1860s, another treaty council was convened at Fort Laramie. When it was ratified, the 1868 Treaty set aside a large tract of unceded land, including the Black Hills, for the \"absolute and undisturbed use and occupation\" of the Lakotan people. Despite this, the U.S. soon began violating the terms of its own treaty, culminating in a brutal massacre at Wounded Knee, wherein the United States killed nearly three hundred unarmed Lakotans. Earlier that same year, in March 1890, Fort Laramie was abandoned and sold.</p>","startTime":1,"endTime":6},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.557564,42.20255]},"id":7},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Fort C.F.
